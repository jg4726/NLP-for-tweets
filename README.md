# Text Data
This notebook assumes that you have a text dataset available for analysis. You can use any dataset of your choice, such as a collection of documents, tweets, or web pages. The notebook provides code for loading and visualizing the text data using pandas.

# Text Preprocessing
The notebook includes code for preprocessing the text data, such as:

1. Converting the text to lowercase
2. Removing special characters and digits
3. Tokenizing the text into words
4. Removing stopwords
5. Applying stemming or lemmatization

# Text Analysis
The notebook demonstrates various techniques for analyzing the preprocessed text data, such as:

1. Generating word frequency distributions
2. Creating word clouds
3. Performing POS tagging
4. Extracting named entities
5. Training and evaluating text classification models
